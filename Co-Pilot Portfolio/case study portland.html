    <h1>Portland Airbnb Dashboard Case Study</h1>
    
    <section>
      <p>
        Having a close connection to Portland, I was particularly interested in exploring how Airbnb listings are distributed across the city and how they contribute to the local community. This project allowed me to combine my passion for data analysis with a real-world application, providing valuable insights into a sector that is both economically significant and rapidly evolving.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes Airbnb data for Portland for the years 2024-2025. The dashboard includes various charts to analyze room type listings, revenue trends, and pricing across neighborhoods.

      <h2>Business Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What is the distribution of different room types in Portland?</li>
        <li>Which room types are most popular in different neighborhoods?</li>
        <li>What are the monthly revenue trends for Airbnb in Portland for 2024-2025?</li>

      <h2>Dashboard Process</h2>
      <h3>Step 1: Data Preparation</h3>
      <p>
        Obtained Airbnb data for Portland, Oregon, for the years 2024-2025 directly from the Airbnb website. Ensured the dataset included information on room types, prices, revenue, neighborhoods, and dates. Used tools such as Excel and MySQL to clean the data, remove duplicates and missing values, and standardize date formats.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2: Import Data into Tableau</h3>
      <p>
        Connected the cleaned dataset as a CSV/Excel file to Tableau by navigating to the “Data” menu and selecting “New Data Source.”
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Create the Dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        Created individual charts based on the business questions. When all charts were ready, added them to the dashboard. Charts include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Distinct Count of Room Type Listings</li>
        <li>Revenue by Month</li>
        <li>Room Type Price by Neighborhood</li>
        <li>Price by Neighborhood</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Step 4: Enhance the Dashboard</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Interactivity</li>
        <li>Aesthetics</li>
        <li>Validation</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Step 5: Provide Key Insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dominance of Entire Home/Apt Listings:</strong> Indicates a strong preference for privacy and space. Marketing efforts could emphasize the benefits of having an entire place to oneself, especially for families or larger groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal Revenue Trends:</strong> Peak months likely correspond to summer. Understanding these trends can help in planning marketing campaigns and adjusting pricing strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Neighborhood-Specific Strategies:</strong> High-priced neighborhoods might benefit from marketing that emphasizes luxury and exclusive experiences. Lower-priced neighborhoods might highlight value and affordability.</li>
        <li><strong>Price Variation Across Neighborhoods:</strong> Significant price variations suggest a diverse market. High-priced neighborhoods like King and Richmond may be more desirable due to their location or amenities.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
